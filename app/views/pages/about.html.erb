  <div class="about__wrap">
    <p>There is this initial layer of trust and understanding that you as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community feel when you meet another queer person. It is really hard to find that by coincidence. Especially when travelling, you have to rely on your network.</p>
    <p>As a woman and/or queer person, travelling is connected to a higher risk. With Quouch, we provide an environment to be faster around people you feel warm and safe with.</p>

          <h2>Meet Nora (she/her). Founder</h2>
          <p>Nora used to travel a lot using Couchsurfing. At some point, she was fed up with the amount of creepy guys she was meeting. Especially as a queer woman, that was pretty annoying. She realized: It does not have to be like this. That was the start of Quouch. Aside, she performs and produces music as her alter ego "Herr Nora" (herrnora.com).</p>

          <h2>Meet Lisbeth (she/her). The tech brain</h2>
          <p>Responsible for bread and butter, heart and soul. Problem solver and in-house Genius, Lisbeth is building the app you soon will be using every time you travel. When she is not working, she is spending her entire time (and money) in Berlins clubs and Yoga studios. It literally IS either the one or the other.</p>
